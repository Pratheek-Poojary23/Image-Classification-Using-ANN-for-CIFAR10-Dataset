# 🖼️ Image Classification Using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

This project demonstrates how to perform basic **image classification** using a feedforward **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** built with TensorFlow/Keras. The goal is to classify grayscale or RGB images into distinct categories using a fully connected neural network model.

## 📌 Objective

Build and train a simple ANN to classify images from a standard dataset and evaluate its performance.

## 🧠 Highlights

- Loaded and preprocessed image data (e.g., MNIST or Fashion MNIST)
- Normalized pixel values for model training
- Created a deep neural network using Keras `Sequential` API
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy and loss plots

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- Python 
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 File Contents

- `image_classification using ANN.ipynb`: Main notebook containing the ANN implementation and results.
